# nonors: Nonogram solver
Bart Massey

This Rust nonogram solver is essentially shadowing my work
with @ArtofBugs on a [Java solver](/ArtofBugs/Nonograms).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to @ArtofBugs for a fun collaboration.

Thanks to @mikix for
[`nonogram-db`](http://github.com/mikix/nonogram-db), from
which a few of the example nonograms and the file format
were taken.
